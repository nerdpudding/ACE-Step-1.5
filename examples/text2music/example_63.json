    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\nOne two three four!\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey tell us what to think and say\nTry to control us every day\nBut we won't be their puppets anymore\nWe're breaking down the door\n\n[Chorus]\nWe won't conform! We won't obey!\nWe're gonna do it our own way!\nNo more lies! No more chains!\nWe're taking back our lives again!\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuit and tie they sell their souls\nEmpty promises and empty goals\nBut we see through their disguise\nTime to open up your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nWe won't conform! We won't obey!\nWe're gonna do it our own way!\nNo more lies! No more chains!\nWe're taking back our lives again!\n\n[Bridge]\n\nStand up! Fight back!\nStand up! Fight back!\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis is our generation's call\nUnited we will never fall\nRaise your fist into the air\nShow them that we're everywhere\n\n[Final Chorus]\nWe won't conform! We won't obey!\nWe're gonna do it our own way!\nNo more lies! No more chains!\nWe're taking back our lives!\n\n[Outro]\nOi! Oi! Oi!",
