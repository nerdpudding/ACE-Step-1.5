    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nLate night thoughts and coffee steam\nChasing shadows of a dream\nBooks are open mind is closed\nWhere this journey goes who knows\n\n[Chorus]\nJust breathe and let it flow\nTake it easy take it slow\nThe answers come in time\nPeace of mind peace of mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nRain drops tapping on the glass\nWatching hours slowly pass\nIn this moment I am free\nJust the music and me\n\n[Chorus]\nJust breathe and let it flow\nTake it easy take it slow\nThe answers come in time\nPeace of mind peace of mind\n\n[Bridge]\n\nLet the worries fade away\nTomorrow is another day\n\n[Outro]\nPeace of mind",
