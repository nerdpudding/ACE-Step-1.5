    "caption": "A gritty blues rock track with overdriven electric guitar riffs, walking bass line, and raspy male vocals. The production features vintage tube amp warmth, Hammond organ fills, and a driving shuffle beat that captures raw emotional intensity.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWoke up this morning with the devil on my back\nMy woman left me and she ain't coming back\nPoured myself some whiskey to ease the pain\nBut every drop just reminds me of her name\n\n[Chorus]\nI got the blues down in my bones\nSitting here all alone\nHeartache is all I've known\nI got the blues down in my bones\n\n[Verse 2]\nWorked my fingers bloody for twenty years\nGave her everything now I'm drowning in tears\nShe took the car and she took my pride\nLeft me with nothing but this pain inside\n\n[Chorus]\nI got the blues down in my bones\nSitting here all alone\nHeartache is all I've known\nI got the blues down in my bones\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSun going down on another lonely night\nI'll keep on fighting till I see the light\nThese blues won't break me I've been here before\nI'll pick myself up off this barroom floor\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nI got the blues down in my bones\nBut I won't stay here alone\nGonna find my way back home\nI got the blues but I'll carry on",
