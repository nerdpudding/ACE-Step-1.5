    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nCity lights blur through the window pane\nI trace your name in the morning rain\nMemories float like dust in the air\nI reach for you but you're not there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe were young and we were free\nNow you're just a ghost to me\n\n[Chorus]\nFading photographs on my wall\nI still hear your voice in the hall\nTime moves on but I'm standing still\nGuess I always will, guess I always will\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour favorite song plays on the radio\nI turn it up then I let it go\nSome things change and some things stay\nBut you're the one that got away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe were young and we were free\nNow you're just a ghost to me\n\n[Chorus]\nFading photographs on my wall\nI still hear your voice in the hall\nTime moves on but I'm standing still\nGuess I always will, guess I always will\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe in another life\nWe could get the timing right\n\n[Outro]\nFading, fading away",
