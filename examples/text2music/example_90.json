    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWelcome to the show tonight\nWhere shadows dance in candlelight\nTake your seat and hold on tight\nThings aren't always what they seem\n\n[Verse 2]\nBehind the curtain secrets hide\nMasks we wear to save our pride\nBut when the spotlight hits the stage\nWe bare our souls upon this page\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is but a cabaret my friend\nA beautiful show that has to end\nSo raise your glass and join the dance\nThis might be your only chance\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe clown who cries the queen who falls\nThe echoes bouncing off these walls\nWe're all performers in this play\nMaking magic every day\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is but a cabaret my friend\nA beautiful show that has to end\n\n[Outro]\nThe show must go on",
