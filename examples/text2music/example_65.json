    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nStaring at the ceiling at 3 AM\nWondering how I got here again\nAll the paths I didn't take\nAll the choices I didn't make\n\n[Verse 2]\nPhotographs of who I used to be\nA stranger looking back at me\nSomewhere along the way I lost my name\nBut I'm done playing their game\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm finding my way back to myself\nDusting off dreams from the shelf\nNo more hiding who I am\nThis is where my life began\nFinding my way back\n\n[Verse 3]\nBurned the map they drew for me\nNow I'm finally running free\nEvery scar tells a story\nThis is my territory\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm finding my way back to myself\nDusting off dreams from the shelf\nNo more hiding who I am\nThis is where my life began\nFinding my way back\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's never too late to start again\nTo rise up from where you've been\n\n[Final Chorus]\nI'm finding my way back to myself\nThis is where my life began\nFinding my way back\n\n[Outro]",
