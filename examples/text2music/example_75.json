    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\nLet's go!\n\n[Verse 1]\nDemon in my head won't let me sleep\nDarkness running through me running deep\nEverybody fake everybody lies\nWatch the world burn before my eyes\nRage inside me can't contain\nFuel the fire feel the pain\nBreaking chains breaking free\nThis is the real me\n\n[Chorus]\nChaos! In my veins!\nChaos! Break the chains!\nChaos! Feel no pain!\nChaos!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey don't understand what I've been through\nJudging from the outside with no clue\nBattle scars across my soul\nLost myself but now I'm whole\nRising from the ashes of the past\nBuilt to break but built to last\nNo more hiding who I am\nThis is my final stand\n\n[Chorus]\nChaos! In my veins!\nChaos! Break the chains!\nChaos! Feel no pain!\nChaos!\n\n[Breakdown]\n\nCan't stop me now!\n\n[Outro]\nChaos!",
