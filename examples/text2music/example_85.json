    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWaking in a world that's not my own\nSeeds of doubt have long been sown\nReality is bending at the seams\nCan't tell the difference between life and dreams\n\n[Verse 2]\nClockwork minds and digital souls\nPlaying predetermined roles\nAre we the masters or the slaves\nOf the futures that we crave\n\n[Chorus]\nParallel dimensions collide\nNowhere left to run and hide\nThe truth is stranger than we know\nLet the revelation flow\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 3]\nQuantum leaps through space and time\nSearching for the paradigm\nEvery answer breeds more questions still\nClimbing up the endless hill\n\n[Chorus]\nParallel dimensions collide\nNowhere left to run and hide\n\n[Outro]",
