    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nMidnight city streets are wet\nNeon signs and silhouettes\nWalking through the urban maze\nLost inside this purple haze\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the shadows we exist\nLike smoke we twist and drift\nAnonymous and free\nThis is where I need to be\n\n[Verse 2]\nConcrete jungle breathing slow\nSecrets only night will know\nEvery corner tells a tale\nBeauty hiding behind the veil\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the shadows we exist\nLike smoke we twist and drift\nAnonymous and free\nThis is where I need to be\n\n[Bridge]\n\nThe city never sleeps\nIts heart forever beats\n\n[Outro]\nIn the shadows\nIn the shadows",
