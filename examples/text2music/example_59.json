    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nAutumn leaves are falling down\nCovering this sleepy town\nI walk alone these empty streets\nWhere our memories still meet\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe coffee shop where we first talked\nThe park bench where we always walked\nNow just ghosts of what we were\nSeasons change but I'm still here\n\n[Chorus]\nLike the river flows to sea\nYou flowed right out of me\nAnd I'm left here wondering\nWhere did all the time go\nWhere did all the time go\n\n[Verse 3]\nI found your letter yesterday\nWords you never got to say\nFolded up and tucked away\nIn a box of yesterday\n\n[Chorus]\nLike the river flows to sea\nYou flowed right out of me\nAnd I'm left here wondering\nWhere did all the time go\nWhere did all the time go\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe someday I'll understand\nWhy you let go of my hand\n\n[Outro]\nWhere did all the time go",
