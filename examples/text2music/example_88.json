    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nTwo lane highway stretching far\nChasing down the evening star\nWindows down and radio on\nSinging to our favorite song\n\n[Verse 2]\nPassed the town where we first met\nA night I never will forget\nYoung and wild without a plan\nJust a girl and just a man\n\n[Chorus]\nMiles and memories behind us now\nWe made it through somehow\nStill together still in love\nThank the stars above\n\n[Verse 3]\nHair is gray but hearts are young\nBest songs still remain unsung\nEvery wrinkle tells our tale\nLove that never once grew stale\n\n[Chorus]\nMiles and memories behind us now\nWe made it through somehow\nStill together still in love\nThank the stars above\n\n[Outro]\nThank the stars above",
