    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nDriving down these old dirt roads\nWhere the cotton fields and memories grow\nPassed the church where grandma prayed\nAnd the creek where we used to wade\n\n[Verse 2]\nDaddy's truck is rusting now\nBut I still remember how\nHe taught me everything I know\nAbout working hard and letting go\n\n[Chorus]\nThese roots run deep beneath my feet\nThrough every joy and every defeat\nNo matter where this life may lead\nI'll always know where I come from\nThese roots run deep\n\n[Verse 3]\nMama's kitchen smells the same\nBiscuits rising, her love unchanged\nSunday dinners, family ties\nThe simple things money can't buy\n\n[Chorus]\nThese roots run deep beneath my feet\nThrough every joy and every defeat\nNo matter where this life may lead\nI'll always know where I come from\nThese roots run deep\n\n[Bridge]\nCity lights may call my name\nBut this red clay runs through my veins\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nThese roots run deep beneath my feet\nI'll always know where I come from\nThese roots run deep",
