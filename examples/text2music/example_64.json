    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nSmoke curls up in the dim lit room\nSaxophone plays a midnight tune\nStrangers meet with a knowing glance\nWould you care to share this dance\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the blue hour of the night\nEverything feels just right\nLet the music set the mood\nJazz and wine and solitude\n\n[Verse 2]\nIce cubes clink in a crystal glass\nMoments like these they never last\nBut tonight we'll make them stay\nLet tomorrow fade away\n\n[Sax Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe pianist plays with gentle hands\nOnly the night understands\nThese melodies of love and loss\nWorth whatever it may cost\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the blue hour of the night\nEverything feels just right\nLet the music set the mood\nJazz and wine and solitude\n\n[Outro]\nJazz and wine and solitude",
