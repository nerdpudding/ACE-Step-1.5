    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nPolaroid pictures on the wall\nReminders of before the fall\nYour handwriting on a note\nWords you carefully wrote\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe apartment still smells like you\nMorning coffee for two\nNow I drink alone and stare\nAt your empty chair\n\n[Chorus]\nGhosts of summer haunt these halls\nEchoes bouncing off the walls\nI'm still here where you left me\nWaiting for a memory\n\n[Verse 3]\nYour books still line the shelf\nI can't move them myself\nIt would mean that you're really gone\nSo I just carry on\n\n[Chorus]\nGhosts of summer haunt these halls\nEchoes bouncing off the walls\nI'm still here where you left me\nWaiting for a memory\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe time will ease this ache\nMaybe hearts are meant to break\n\n[Outro]\nGhosts of summer\nGhosts of you",
