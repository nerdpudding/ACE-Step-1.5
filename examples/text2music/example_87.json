    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nFluorescent lights flicker and fade\nAnother night another masquerade\nFaces blur in the crowded room\nDancing slowly toward our doom\n\n[Verse 2]\nConversations without meaning\nSmiles that hide the silent screaming\nWe perform our daily roles\nEmpty vessels hollow souls\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just ghosts in the machine\nGoing through motions in between\nSearching for something that feels real\nSomething that we can truly feel\n\n[Verse 3]\nConcrete towers touch the sky\nMillions living asking why\nConnected yet so far apart\nLonely beats of every heart\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just ghosts in the machine\nGoing through motions in between\n\n[Outro]\nGhosts in the machine",
