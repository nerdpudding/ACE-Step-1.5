We stand as one!\nUnbreakable! Until it's done!\nThrough fire and pain we will remain\nUnbreakable!\n\n[Verse 2]\nScars of war upon our skin\nEvery loss fuels the fire within\nNo surrender no retreat\nVictory or defeat\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe are the ones they fear\nOur time is finally here\n\n[Chorus]\nUnbreakable! We stand as one!\nUnbreakable! Until it's done!\nThrough fire and pain we will remain\nUnbreakable!\n\n[Breakdown]\n\nFight! Fight! Fight!\nWe will never fall!\n\n[Bridge]\n\nFrom the darkness we emerge\nOn the edge of the world\n\n[Final Chorus]\nUnbreakable! We stand as one!\nUnbreakable! Until it's done!\nUnbreakable!\n\n[Outro]",
