    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nShadows crawling up the wall\nI can hear the silence call\nDigital dreams in analog skin\nLet the darkness pull me in\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLosing grip on what is real\nTell me what am I supposed to feel\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the void I find my peace\nWhere the noise will finally cease\nFloat away into the black\nNever looking back\n\n[Verse 2]\nScreens are glowing in the night\nArtificial satellite\nConnected yet so alone\nSearching for a place called home\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the void I find my peace\nWhere the noise will finally cease\nFloat away into the black\nNever looking back\n\n[Bridge]\n\nStatic fills my mind\nLeaving self behind\n\n[Outro]\nFloat away\nFloat away",
