Get up!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSaturday night and the city's alive\nPut on your dancing shoes it's time to arrive\nThe DJ's spinning and the floor is hot\nGive me everything you got\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan you feel it in your feet\nMoving to that funky beat\n\n[Chorus]\nGet down, get funky tonight\nLet the rhythm take you high\nGet down, get funky with me\nSet your body free\nOw!\n\n[Verse 2]\nLeave your troubles at the door\nWe came to party nothing more\nThe bass is thumping through the floor\nCome on y'all let me hear you roar\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan you feel it in your feet\nMoving to that funky beat\n\n[Chorus]\nGet down, get funky tonight\nLet the rhythm take you high\nGet down, get funky with me\nSet your body free\n\n[Bridge]\n\nBrass section take it!\nNow bring it back!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe don't stop till the morning light\nKeep on grooving feeling right\nThis is what we live for\nFunk forever more\n\n[Outro]\nGet down!
