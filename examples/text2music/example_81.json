    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nDrifting through a haze of sound\nFeet not touching the ground\nColors bleeding into one\nChasing shadows of the sun\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour voice echoes in my head\nWords that never could be said\nFading like a photograph\nMemories cut in half\n\n[Chorus]\nLost in waves of noise\nSearching for your voice\nEverything dissolves\nInto the void\n\n[Verse 3]\nTime moves slow then fast\nNothing ever lasts\nBeauty in decay\nWashing all away\n\n[Chorus]\nLost in waves of noise\nSearching for your voice\nEverything dissolves\nInto the void\n\n[Outro]\n\nInto the void\nInto the void",
